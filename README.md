# 🚀 A2SV Interview Preparation

This repository is dedicated to my preparation for the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) interview process. It reflects my commitment to mastering core algorithmic techniques and building the consistency needed to thrive in competitive programming and technical interviews.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

I'm currently sharpening my skills in the following foundational topics:

- 🔁 **Sorting** – mastering built-in and custom sorting strategies
- 🎯 **Two Pointers** – efficient traversal for arrays and strings
- 🪟 **Sliding Window** – optimized subarray and substring analysis
- ➕ **Prefix Sum** – fast cumulative computations and range queries
- 🧱 **Stack** – solving problems with order, memory, and structure

Each folder contains:
- 📂 Problem link
- ✅ Clean solutions

## 🌱 Why A2SV?

A2SV empowers African students to reach top tech companies through algorithmic excellence and community-driven growth. This repo is my launchpad—where I build the habits, mindset, and technical depth to earn my spot and contribute meaningfully.

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms

- Language: Mostly Python 
- Platforms: HackerRank, LeetCode, Codeforces, A2SV problem sets
